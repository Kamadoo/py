The file above is a Simple CRUD system with no links between databases or anything, it isn't meant to be fully funciontional but will do the basics without storing data.
The main focus on this project was to learn a bit more about myself while coding and learning how python functions.
Its based and fully made in Python.
It's ready to use, just not ready to link to some databases, so some changes might be needed.
